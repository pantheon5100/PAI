## Abstract 

Although recent studies on time-series anomaly detection have increasingly adopted ever-larger neural network architectures such as transformers and foundation models, they incur high computational costs and memory usage, making them impractical for real-time and resource-constrained scenarios. Moreover, they often fail to demonstrate significant performance gains over simpler methods under rigorous evaluation protocols. In this study, we propose Patch-based representation learning for time-series Anomaly detection (PaAno), a lightweight yet effective method for fast and efficient time-series anomaly detection. PaAno extracts short temporal patches from time-series training data and uses a 1D convolutional neural network to embed each patch into a vector representation. The model is trained using a combination of triplet loss and pretext loss to ensure the embeddings capture informative temporal patterns from input patches. During inference, the anomaly score at each time step is computed by comparing the embeddings of its surrounding patches to those of normal patches extracted from the training time-series. Evaluated on the TSB-AD benchmark, PaAno achieved state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods, including those based on heavy architectures, on both univariate and multivariate time-series anomaly detection across various range-wise and point-wise performance measures.

## Installation

Clone the repository and set up the environment as follows:

```bash
# Make conda environment
conda create -n PaAno python=3.11 -y
conda activate PaAno

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Quick Start

We provide a shell script for convenient execution. Once dependencies are installed, simply run:

```bash
# Univariate time-series anomaly detection
bash script/run_uni.sh
```
or 

```bash
# Multivariate time-series anomaly detection
bash script/run_mul.sh
```

This will launch PaAno with the default configuration. Sample data from the TSB-AD benchmark are included in the data/ directory for quick and easy start.

Task-specific experiment runners and helpers are grouped under `tasks/`. Legacy root entrypoints such as `task18_score.py` and `run_task19_score.py` remain as compatibility wrappers so existing launch commands still work.
